This assignment is implemented according to the Computer Vision couse work.
Written code implements the followings:
1.Reading 4 images from Original_images folder

2. Converting RGB images to Grayscale format

3. Discretizing the Grayscale images to lower levels(4)

4. Converting Grayscale images to Binary threshold values are determined by Otsu Algorithm

5. Converting RGB format to HSV format and changing Hue, Saturation and Brightness of Images

6.Taking 2 points (1-Object,2-Background ) from image and Finding close colors in the image to the given points. Final output is Distance matrix (black points are close, white points are different). 
## Installation

The following packages are required:

OpenCV 
Skimage

pip install opencv-python
pip install skimage


## Run

Input images are in the Original_images directory.

Run the script script.py

Select two points from the opened image(1-from object,2-from background)

Output images will be stored in corresponding directories.
